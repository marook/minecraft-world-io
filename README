Current Status

Right now minecraft-world-io is partly broken. At least these things won't
work right now:
* the test cases
* reading chunks with some specific stuff in it :-)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation

To install minecraft-world-io into your home directory type the following:

$ python setup.py install --home ~/.local

If you haven't already extended your local python path then add the following
to your environment configuration script. For example to your .bashrc:

export PYTHONPATH=~/.local/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage

You can export minecraft blocks into povray format:

$ mv_world_to_pov <path to world> <min coord> <max coord>

The world will be written to <path to world>.pov

Example:
$ mc_world_to_pov .minecraft/saves/demo -50,0,-50 50,128,50

Be warned: big dumps take a LOT of calculation time!

Chunks which can't be parsed will not appear in the povray file. Also you will
see some stacktraces in the console.

Use the material definitions in the etc/textures directory to render an image
using povray. Write me an email if you need further information. I'm waiting to
hear from you.
